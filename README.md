The goal of this project is to optimize the garbage collection system in Prague
with route visualization.
Based on the addresses of garbage cans and the time stamp of collection, an algorithm was created to optimize the collection route.
Data contained in the data set:
1. Trash can details (address, GPS, etc.)
2. Measurements (fullness, battery status, etc.)
3. collection (timestamp when the collection took place).
The data was obtained from the API: https://golemioapi.docs.apiary.io/#reference/waste
